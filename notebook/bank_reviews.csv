For the most part it's all right and does what I need. using zelle has been a nightmare. I've gone through at least six different people to try and get it to pay someone. I gave up and will change to a different form of payment. I will still use the app to deposit checks,3,2025-06-07,Chase,Google Play Store

Great app but it needs to be a little simple to use for the average person.,5,2025-06-06,Chase,Google Play Store
No MFA. That's pretty substantial (and substandard) for a financial app.,3,2025-06-06,Chase,Google Play Store
"I guess texting for two step verification is just too good? too easy? I have to do a phone call to receive a code, bad enough, but thing is I'm not receiving the call, I'm getting voicemails telling me to answer but nothing in my call history and I have no numbers blocked on my phone, even if my phone detects spam it still rings and says spam.",1,2025-06-06,Chase,Google Play Store

I have been with Chase for years now and they always have incentives that either save me money or get me cash back. They have increased my credit limit more times without me requesting it like I have to do with my other cards.

"horrible app and horrible company. it's hard to get through and talk to anybody on the phone. I've had my account for over 10 years and they haven't lowered my rates once despite calling and asking. the app keeps wanting to verify my identity and I've scanned my ID numerous times at this point and it won't accept it.

"Easy to use, nice design, clean feeling. I've said it once before and I'll say it again with more detail. The cash back feature on this app is my favorite. It beats other banking apps that I've used. Other apps will only allow cash back as a statement credit. Chase gives you the option of statement credit or cash back sent to another checking account. Because of this, I am willing to keep using chase instead of other banks. Thank you, Chase.",5,2025-06-05,Chase,Google Play Store

"Don't use this bank or app unless you want to be constantly asked what you are doing with your money and whatnot. I understand that scamming has become more rampant lately, but good grief. Why I got to explain myself about what I do with my money? Also, if they close your account(s), don't expect an answer if you ask them. They'll just tell you that they don't know when they clearly do. (As a former customer, I feel like I have the right to know why my account(s) were closed)",1,2025-06-04,Chase,Google Play Store

"I don't know if I trust Chase Bank anymore. I filed a complaint against a company that overcharged me. They charged me 2 times for the same service on the same day. I filed a claim with Chase, and they said it was a legitimate charge. I filed another claim and explained that it was the same charge for the same service on the0 same day. Finally, they did reimburse me. I almost switched banks because of this. If a bank does not have my back, i'm going elsewhere.",3,2025-05-29,Chase,Google Play Store

Thanks, ü§óChase!",5,2025-05-26,Chase,Google Play Store
I love Chase banking. They explain exactly how the process of a returned item is credited back to your account & they accomplish that right away. The online banking is easy to do & there are no problems to file a claim. It's simple & they are always kind & patient. I use my Chase debit card alot so when I have to return a item they simply credit that particular sale item & they take it from there. Simplicity is how they work. It's appreciated & I'm one satisfied customer. Love ‚ù§Ô∏è this bank!,5,2025-05-26,Chase,Google Play Store

Suddenly I can't lock or unlock the Chase debit card from either the mobile app or the desktop app. This is a few days now! For a bank this size I think it is unusual. What's really going on?,1,2025-05-25,Chase,Google Play Store
"they put ads inside their banking app, and sell info. also they refuse to remove or lower cash advance portion of their credit card, and claim that you enter a pin to do a cash advance and then you have surprises that did not require a pin with their mandatory 30% apr for cash advance+10$ my credit isnt bad, if it was bad the credit union wouldnt give me 6% apr. chase is just a bad actor that gives everyone the 20%-26% apr rate on their card and 5% points on travel is now only in app purchases",1,2025-05-25,Chase,Google Play Store
Terrible experience for foreign travel. I'm not getting fraud alerts when I travel. It's just declining my card intermittently. their documentation all says that you don't need to report travel(and can't self service report travel) because of their magical fraud alerts(which aren't working and none of the 5 people they've transferred me to know how to set up). Instead customer service has now set up travel on my account. Ridiculous,2,2025-05-25,Chase,Google Play Store

"I love Wells Fargo Bank because they always take good care of me. They watch out for anything that might be fraudulent, and they alert me to ensure that the questionable expense was mine. When people have tried to scam me, they don't pay the bad guy. When I file a claim for fraud, they investigate and if they have already paid it, they will return the money to me while they investigate. If I overdraw my account, they give me two days to make a deposit before charging me an overdraft fee.",5,2025-05-21,Wells Fargo,Google Play Store
